# MATLAB


## History of MATLAB

MATLAB is a programming language in which mathematical notation is used and algorithms and mathematical functions are developed.

MATLAB was not originally a programming language, its development began in the late 1970s.The person who started to develop was Cleve Moler.Cleve Moler's main goal in developing MATLAB was that his students could access EISPACK and LINPACK without needing to use Fortran.MATLAB, which started to be developed for this purpose, became popular in the field of mathematics in a short time.Immediately after its popularity increased, engineer Jack Little and his friend Steve Bangert realized the mathematical potential of MATLAB and offered cooperation to Moler.After this solidarity, they re-encoded MATLAB in language C. And in 1984 they launched PC-MATLAB.


## Why was MATLAB invented?

As we mentioned above; MATLAB was developed to enable a teacher to reach LINPACK and EISPACK to their students without using any other programming language.


-When/why shall we use MATLAB?

MATLAB; It started like a simple calculator and went a long way.It is very common to use MATLAB especially in engineering applications. 
It is frequently used in the analysis of systems and in the visualization of mathematical calculations.MATLAB has a mathematical function library that can perform the calculation of linear algebra and matrices as a math product.

The main areas use of MATLAB are:
-Numerical Linear Algebra Calculations
-Data Analysis and Visualization
-Creating Graphics for Big Data
-Algorithm Development
-Machine Learning
-Data Science
-Deep Learning
-Creating Graphical User Interface and Application Programming Interface
-Simulation

with MATLAB,
You can apply and design different algorithms using MATLAB.
By uploading data from different sources such as file, database or internet into MATLAB,you can analyze them or have them visualized with various options.
You can still simulate data models, prototypes and products you design or calculate with MATLAB.
You can also design interfaces for users and even MATLAB to work with other programming applications more easily.


-How to setup an environment to use it in different platforms?

Some universities provide free access to MATLAB for their learners to use.

For Windows:
You should first visit https://www.mathworks.com/?s_tid=gn_logo and download it to the desktop via the internet.
Then, you should start the program by double-clicking the matlab icon.
Also;
-Windows 10 systems — Start > All apps > MATLAB Release

Windows 8 systems — On the Start screen or the desktop, click MATLAB Release.

Windows 7 systems — If you chose to have the installer put a shortcut to the MATLAB program on the Windows Start menu, then select Start > MATLAB Release.
